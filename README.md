# PlotterNC Studio

**Open-source plotting and CAM software for PlotterNC-powered machines.**

![PlotterNC Studio Toolpath Preview](src/image-1.png)

PlotterNC Studio is a modern web-based CAM application designed for pen plotters and other 2D CNC machines. It allows users to import vector artwork, generate optimized toolpaths, preview jobs, simulate machine motion, and export machine-ready G-code directly from the browser.

> PlotterNC Studio currently focuses on CAM and toolpath generation for pen plotters. Support for additional PlotterNC-powered machines is planned for future releases.
